what i know
-----------------
There's a root node
the left node is less than root node, actually the whole left side is less than root node
right is more than root

 a bst class should have a root node property with the value of null in constructor
 the bst needs a few methods that use the node class
 these methods mainly use conditional statements to determine what happens in the bst
 a node class has a value(2,3,29,55), it also has a left node property and right node
